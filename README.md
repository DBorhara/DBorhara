# Welcome to My Online Home Away from Home

I am software engineer with a dedicated work ethic and proven leadership qualities obtained from years of working in high level government and nonprofit management. I helped engage with over 1.2 million individuals as part of a team to ensure proper governmental services were being distributed at a municipal level. I am passionate about professional growth and coding, with a desire to join and support a highly functional development team. I am also excited to learn about problem solving with efficient solutions, and growing into a leadership position.
